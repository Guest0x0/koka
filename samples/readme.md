# Koka Examples

* `syntax`: start with this folder where each file
  describes a particular feature of Koka, like `with`-syntax, implicit parameters, local qualification, etc.
* `handlers`: examples of algebraic effect handlers.
* `basic`: some small Koka programs that demonstrate various features.  

## VS Code integration

Inside the VS Code editor, it can be useful to see the inferred types, fully qualified names, and implicit
parameters. Press and hold `ctrl+alt` (or `ctrl+option` on MacOS) to show these inlay hints.

Moreover, you can execute any `main`, `test..`, and `example..` functions directly in the debug console by clicking on the `run debug | optimized` code lenses displayed above these functions.
